Project Overview

This project focuses on applying data science and machine learning techniques to veterinary clinic data in order to provide valuable insights and predictions for business optimization. By analyzing data related to veterinary services, consultations, treatments, and income, we aim to provide actionable insights for improving clinic operations, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

The main components of the project include:
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Thorough analysis of key features like treatment types, consultation times, total income, and customer repeat visits.

    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and transforming data for modeling.

2. Feature Engineering:

    Created new features such as Revenue per Minute, Income Category, Consultation Time Category, and others to better capture patterns in the data.

3. Machine Learning Models:

    Supervised Learning Models: Trained and fine-tuned several machine learning models, including LightGBM, Neural Networks (MLPClassifier), and Random Forest, to predict customer behavior like repeat visits and treatment success.

4. Interactive Data Dashboard:

    Built an interactive dashboard using Plotly and Dash to visualize key metrics such as:

        Monthly income distribution

        Treatment cost vs. consultation time

        Repeat customer rate

        Income by treatment type

This allows users to dynamically explore data and make informed decisions.
5. Cost Optimization & Disease Association Analysis:

    Applied the Apriori Algorithm to identify relationships between different diseases and procedures.

    Cost Optimization: Visualized treatment costs across various types to help optimize the clinic's expenses.

Technologies Used:

    Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc.)

    Machine Learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, LightGBM)

    Data Visualization (Plotly, Dash)

    Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and model development

    FPDF for generating reports
